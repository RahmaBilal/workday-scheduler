# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Your Task

In this task, I created a simple calendar application that allows users to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. It is simple and easy to use especially for a user who is extremely busy and wants to manage their time effectively. 



You'll need to use the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with date and time. Be sure to read the documentation carefully and concentrate on using Moment.js in the browser.



## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
