# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Description

In this task, I created a simple calendar application that allows users to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. It is simple and easy to use especially for a user who is extremely busy and wants to manage their time effectively. 


## What's included in the file:
- Current time and date displayed at the top of the page
- Time coordinated time blocks referring to past, present and future
- Time blocks and information that are saved go into the local storage


## Features:
```md
- HTML
- CSS
- JQUERY
- MOMENT.JS
- BOOTSTRAP
```

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
